This project explores the development and implementation of an advanced sales forecasting model tailored to "Summer Habit" for accurate, actionable predictions. With precise forecasts, the business optimizes its operations across various areas. Improved inventory management prevents costly overstock or revenue-limiting stockouts, ensuring customer needs are met consistently. Forecasting also enhances staffing efficiency, aligning staff schedules with peak demand periods to elevate customer satisfaction. Additionally, insights from sales predictions support strategic, targeted marketing campaigns, increasing engagement and driving sales during high-demand periods. This forecasting model further aids in resource allocation, helping management deploy resources effectively across locations and product lines. By monitoring KPIs like inventory turnover, promotion response rates, and labor cost efficiency, "Summer Habit" strengthens its competitive edge, achieving sales growth, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency for sustained business success
